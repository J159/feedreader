# Feedreader Testing

## Description

Project 4 Feedreader Testing - Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

A project on writing effective tests in Jasmine to verify several Feedreader functions. HTML, CSS, app.js, fonts, and Jasmine version 2.1.2 provided by Udacity.

A summary of the Suites/Tests are listed below:

* Suite 1 - RSS Feeds: verify feeds are defined and have a URL and name

* Suite 2 - The Menu: tests if menu is hidden by default and changes visibility when menu icon is clicked

* Suite 3 - Initial Entries: verifies feed container has at least one entry

* Suite 4 - New Feed Selection: loads a new feed and verifies new feed is different from old one

## How to Use

Load index.html to your browser. The feedreader application will load along side Jasmine, which will verify whether suite tests pass or not. All tests are written inside feedreader.js file.
